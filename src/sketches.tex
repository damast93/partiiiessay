\subsection{Definition of sketches}

Sketches have been introduces by Ehresmann. \\

\begin{Definition}[Sketch]
A sketch is tuple $\mathbb S = (\cat A, \dist L, \dist C)$ where $\cat A$ is a small category, $\dist L$ is a set of cones in $\cat A$ and $\dist C$ a set of cocones in $\cat A$.
\end{Definition}
Note that for convenience, we treat our cones not as natural transformations but as special diagrams $D : \cat I \to \cat A$ where $I$ has a distinguished apex $\cat I^+$ and a bottom $\cat I^\bot$ with morphisms $\cat I^+ \to B$ for all $B \in \cat I^\bot$ and no morphisms from $B$ into the apex; analogously for cocones. \\

Sketches form a category $\catname{Sk}$ by letting morphisms $(\cat A, \dist L, \dist C) \to (\cat A', \dist{L'}, \dist{C'})$ be functors $F : \cat A \to \cat A'$ that respect the distinguished cones and cocones, i.e. for all $D \in \dist L$, we have $F \circ D \in \dist{L'}$ and similarly $F \circ D \in \dist{C'}$ for all $D \in \dist C$. \\

\textbf{Remark: } The way we will actually write down sketches to present a theory will look slightly different: Instead of the category $\cat A$, we will usually specify an underlying graph\footnote{directed multigraph} $G$, together with a set $D$ of commutativity conditions between pairs of paths of the same starting- and endpoint. We will then prescribe the cones and cocones accordingly. Note that we get back to our original definition by taking $\cat A$ to be the category freely presented by the $G$ modulo the congruence given by $D$. 

\begin{Definition}[Model of a sketch]
Given a sketch $\mathbb S = (\cat A, \dist L, \dist C)$ and a category $\cat K$, a \emph{model} of $\mathbb S$ in $\cat K$ is a functor
\[ F : \cat A \to \cat K \]
that turns all distinguished cones into limit cones and cocones into colimit cones in $\cat K$, i.e. \begin{itemize}
\item for all $D \in \dist L$, $F \circ D$ is limiting,
\item for all $D \in \dist C$, $F \circ D$ is colimiting.
\end{itemize}
A \emph{morphism of models} is just a natural transformation between the functors, making the category \[ \mod(\mathbb S, \cat K) \]
of $\mathbb S$-models in $\cat K$ a full subcategory of $\fun{\cat A}{\cat K}$. We write
\[ \mod(\mathbb S) := \mod(\mathbb S, \catname{Set}) \]
for the category of set-valued models of $\mathbb S$. Set-valued models will in fact be so important that we call a category \emph{sketchable} if it is equivalent to $\mod(\mathbb S)$ for a sketch $\mathbb S$.
\end{Definition}

\textbf{Remark: } By ignoring set-theoretic restrictions, we could think of taking model categories as a functor
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:modfunctor} \mod(-, \cat K) : \catname{Sk}^\op \to \catname{CAT}
\end{equation}
In general, non-isomorphic sketches can still have equivalent categories of models though. Note that we can assign to every category $\cat K$ an ``underlying large sketch'' 
\[ U(\cat K) = (\cat K, \dist L, \dist C) \]
where $\dist L$ collects all limit cones, $\dist C$ all colimit cones in $\cat K$. Then a model $F : \mathbb S \to \cat K$ is nothing but a sketch morphism $F : \mathbb S \to U(\cat K)$ and (\ref{eq:modfunctor}) is just given by composition of morphisms. 

We can now give names to the the syntactic (better: geometric?) properties of sketches.
\begin{Definition}
We call $\mathbb S = (\cat A, \dist L, \dist C)$
\begin{enumerate}
\item a \emph{limit sketch} if $\dist C$ is empty
\item a \emph{product sketch} if $\dist C$ is empty and all cones in $\dist L$ are \emph{discrete}, i.e. an apex connected to a discrete diagram
\item a \emph{finite product sketch} if $\dist C$ is empty and all cones in $\dist L$ are discrete and finite
\item \emph{$\lambda$-small} if all cones and cocones have underlying $\lambda$-small diagrams
\end{enumerate}
We furthermore say \emph{mixed sketch} to stress that both $\dist L$ and $\dist C$ are nonempty.
\end{Definition}

\subsection{Examples}

In this section, we will see examples on how to sketch theories for known some categories. Note that we have to be careful to distinguish between the vertices and edges of the sketch, and their ``meaning'' as objects and morphisms in a model. \\

 We have already seen the sketch for a binary algebra in the introduction. Let's extend it in the following way:

\begin{Example}[Unital algebras]\label{ex:unitality}
We want to sketch the variety $\cat V$ with a neutral element $e$ such that
\[ m(x, e) = x. \]
We start with a graph on vertices $1, a, a^2$ and edges as described
\[
\xymatrix{
  & a^2 \ar[rd]^{\pi_2} \ar[d]_{m} \ar[ld]_{\pi_1} & & 1 \ar[d]_{e} \\
a & a & a & a
}\]
Note that even though $1$ and $a^2$ are suggestively named, these are just symbols at the moment. We will make them get their intended meaning in the models of the sketch. To make $a^2$ become the actual product of $a$, we needed to add
\[
\xymatrix{
  & p \ar[rd]^{\pi_2} \ar[ld]_{\pi_1} & \\
a & & a
}\]
to $\dist L$. Furthermore, we add to $\dist L$ the empty cone with apex $1$, making it a terminal object. We add an edge
\[ (\id,e) : a \to a^2 \]
and now need to pin down its meaning. Let's introduce another edge $! : a \to 1$. As $1$ will be a terminal object, its meaning is already uniquely defined\footnote{and I will by slight abuse of notation write $!$ for all edges into terminal objects}. Now we can add commutativity relations
\[
\xymatrix{
  & & a \ar[d]^{(\id,e)} \ar@/_/[lldd]^{\id} \ar@/^/[rd]^{!}  & & \\
  & & a^2 \ar[lld]^{\pi_1} \ar[rrd]_{\pi_2} & 1 \ar@/^/[rd]^{e} & \\
a & & & & a
}\]
As $a^2$ will be a limit, the morphism $(\id,e)$ into it will be determined through its projections and thus be uniquely defined as well. Lastly, we can add a commutativity relation\footnote{note that the identity morphism $\id_a$ is uniquely given through the empty path $()$ from $a$ to $a$}
\[ m \cdot (\id,e) = \id_a. \]
Note that natural transformations between models will precisely correspond to the algebraic notion of homomorphisms. By this construction, we have a finite product sketch $\mathbb S$ with two cones such that
\[ \mod(\mathbb S) \simeq \cat V. \]
\end{Example}

\begin{Example}[Groups]
I will just sketch how to sketch the category of groups. For the associative law, we construct ourselves double and triple products
\[
\xymatrix{
  & a^2 \ar[ld]_{\pi_1} \ar[rd]^{\pi_2} &    & & a^3 \ar[ld]_{p_1} \ar[d]^{p_2} \ar[rd]^{p_3} & \\
a &     & a & a & a & a
}\]
with the corresponding discrete limit cones. We want to write down the commutativity
\[ m \circ (m \circ (p_1, p_2), p_3) = m \circ (p_1, m \circ (p_2,p_3)) \]
between paths $a^3 \to a$. All the intermediate edges have to be added to the sketch and their meaning defined uniquely via their projections, e.g by the following commuting diagram
\[
\xymatrix{
& & a^3 \ar[d]^{(p_1,p_2)} \ar@/_2pc/[lldd]_{p_1} \ar@/^2pc/[rrdd]^{p_2} & \\
& & a^2 \ar[lld]_{\pi_1} \ar[rrd]^{\pi_2} & \\
a & & & & a
}\]
Unitality was discussed in \ref{ex:unitality}, and the inversion operation amounts to an edge $\iota : a \to a$ such that \[ m \cdot (\iota, \id) = e \cdot ! = m \cdot (\id, \iota) \]
as paths $a^2 \to a$, where again $!: a^2 \to 1$. 
\end{Example}

This procedure actually shows how to turn any set of identities into a finite product sketch.
\begin{Proposition}
Model categories of finite product sketches are precisely the many-sorted varieties.
\end{Proposition}
\begin{Proof}
For any variety, we have seen how to turn it into a model category of a sketch. \\

Given a finite product sketch $\mathbb S = (\cat A, \dist L)$, we define a variety in the following way: Start by defining a signature with sorts $\obj(\cat A)$ and add unary operation symbols $f : s \to t$ for every morphism $f : s \to t$ in $\cat A$. \\

Add equations
\[ \id_r(x) = x \]
and
\[ f(g(x)) = (f \circ g)(x)  \]
for all morphisms $g : r \to s, f : s \to t$ in $\cat A$ where $x$ is a variable of sort $r$. We can now think of algebras as functors $F : \cat A \to \catname{Set}$. Now encode the limit conditions. For each cone $C = (s \xrightarrow{\pi_i} s_i) \in \dist L$, add an operation symbol $\hat c$ of arity
\[ \hat c : s_1 \times \cdots \times s_n \to s \]
and add equations
\[ \hat c(\pi_1(x), \ldots, \pi_n(x)) = x \]
for $x : s$ and 
\[ \pi_i(\hat c(x_1, \ldots, x_n)) = x_i \]
for all $i=1,\ldots,n$ where $x_i : s_i$.
Every functor $F : \cat A \to \catname{Set}$ that satisfies these equations will induce an isomorphism
\[ F(s) \xrightarrow{(F\pi_1,\ldots, F\pi_n)} F(s_1) \times \cdots \times F(s_n) \]
in $\catname{Set}$, i.e. be a model of the sketch.
\end{Proof}

\begin{Example}[Torsion-free groups]
Let's take a quasivariety like torsion-free groups and look at the implicational axiom
\[ x + x = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 0. \]
We can sketch this using equalisers. Take again vertices $1,a,a^2$ as before and $0_a : 1 \to a$. We can describe the set
\[ e = \{ x : x + x = 0 \} \]
as an equalizer cone
\[
\xymatrix{
& e \ar@/_1pc/[ld]_{j} \ar@/^1pc/[rd] & \\
a \ar@/^/[rr]^{x + x} \ar@/_/[rr]_{0_a \circ !} & & a
}\]
where \[ x + x = + \circ (\id,\id). \]
Now we add commutativity condition expressing $e = \{0\}$ by \[ j = 0_a\cdot !. \]
\end{Example}

\begin{Example}[Simple graphs]
A simple graph is a graph, i.e. a two-sorted variety on sort $v,e$ with operations
\[ s, t : e \to v \]
where there is at most one edge between two vertices, leading to the implicational condition
\begin{equation}\label{eq:graph} s(x) = s(y),\, t(x) = t(y) \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = y \end{equation}
for $x,y : e$. The right hand side can be expressed as a pullback of the map \[ (s,t) : e \to v^2, \]
in fact the condition (\ref{eq:graph}) just says that $(s,t)$ is injective, which is a pullback condition
\[
\xymatrix{
 & e \ar[ld]_{\id} \ar[rd]^{id} & \\
e \ar[rd]_{(s,t)} &  & e \ar[ld]^{(s,t)} \\
 & v^2 &
}\]
\end{Example}

The introduction of cocones allows for more interesting categories
\subsection{Mixed sketches}

\begin{Example}[Fields]
We can almost sketch fields as varieties on the signature $\{0_k,1_k,+,\times,(-)^{-1}\}$ apart from the pathological axiom
\[ x = 0_k \,\vee\,x \times x^{-1} = 1_k. \] 
Introduce a sketch as usual on vertices $1,k,k^2,k^3$ but also add a symbol $k^*$ that we want to represent the nonzero elements of the field. This of course means
\[
\xymatrix{
& k & \\
k^* \ar[ru]^{j} & & 1 \ar[lu]_{0_k}
}\]
has to become a coproduct cone, so add it to $\dist C$. Then define a map 
\[ (x,x^{-1}) : k^* \to k^2 \]
in the obvious way and add a condition on paths $k^* \to k$
\[ \times \circ (x,x^{-1}) = 1_k \circ !. \]
\end{Example}

% Put this in the introduction?
\begin{Example}[Connected graphs]
A surprisingly elegant example is the sketch $\mathbb S$ on vertices $1,e,v$ with terminal object $1$ \[
\xymatrix{
& 1 \\
e \ar@/^/[rr]^{s} \ar@/_/[rr]_{t} \ar[ru] & & v \ar[lu] \\
}\]
Models of $\mathbb S$ will be graphs $(V,E)$, but the distinguished cocone becomes a coequaliser 
\[ 1 \cong V/(s(e)\sim t(e)). \]
The equivalence relation identifies all vertices that are connected by an edge, so there has to be precisely one connected component. $\mathbb S$ axiomatises the category of connected graphs and homomorphisms.
\end{Example}

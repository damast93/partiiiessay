\section{Models are accessible}
\label{sec:sketchesaccessible}

\begin{Corollary}
Locally presentable categories are precisely the model categories of limit sketches.
\end{Corollary}
\begin{Proof}
It remains to show that $\mod(\mathbb S)$ is locally presentable for limit sketches $\mathbb S$. But $\mod(\mathbb S)$ is closed under limits in $\fun{\cat A}{\catname{Set}}$ as limits are computed pointwise and limits commute with limits. Therefore it is complete and accessible, thus locally presentable.
\end{Proof}
